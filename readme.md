We use it in Icehouse.

Tested on a test dump of Newton. Now requires a nova_api database connection

Bugs? Oh, almost certainly.

This tool was written to be used in the CERN Cloud Infrastructure and 
it has been tested only in our environment.

Since it updates nova DB use it with extremely caution.
